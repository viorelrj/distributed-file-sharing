next step:
- Implement a file format:
    info:
      pathname - path to the file location
      checksum - to validate file readiness/integrity (if failed - needs to redownload it from peers)
    id: not a property. The torrents are identified by the sha-1 hash of the info
    - will have a folder that contains the torrent files
    - at startup, lookup in the folder to know available ids
    - accept connections for the hashes
    - The client that downloads - initialize with the torrent file, and a desired output folder

------------
Maybe how it works:
req-client initializes with ID.
Requests from service the list of res-clients with this ID

Picks one of the clients: # (how will avoid supra-saturating one client)?
  - req-client registers with an ID.
  - the res-client looks up the id in id-to-path and then sends contents of path.
  - If failed:
      check another res-client
    else:
      close connection
      start sending heartbeats to service about id availability
